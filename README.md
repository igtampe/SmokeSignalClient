# SmokeSignalClient
A tiny VB.NET Client that can communicate with the SmokeSignal Server. Maybe instead of expecting you guys to check the ViBE source code for the ServerCommand Class, I could just *give it*.

This should be a good base for any VB.NET windows form application that connects to a SmokeSignal server, plus a good tester for your own SmokeSignal server regarding what inputs it should receive.

I hope it's of use!
